## Introduction

Welcome to my **Go by Example** repository! This project documents my journey of learning the Go programming language through practical examples and problem-solving exercises. Inspired by the excellent resource [gobyexample.com](https://gobyexample.com/), this repository aims to provide clear, concise, and hands-on examples to help both beginners and intermediate learners deepen their understanding of Go.

Whether you're just starting with Go or looking to refresh your knowledge, this repository is designed to be a valuable resource for you.

---

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are:

- To showcase my progress in learning Go.
- To create a collection of practical examples that demonstrate key concepts of the Go programming language.
- To serve as a reference for others who are learning Go.
- To solve problems and implement small projects to reinforce my understanding.

Each example is accompanied by code snippets, explanations, and comments to ensure clarity and comprehension.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
/go-by-example
│
├── <topic>/          # Examples covering fundamental Go concepts (e.g., variables, loops, functions)
├── <topic>/projects/ # Small projects built using Go
└── README.md         # This file
```

Each directory contains `.go` files with self-contained examples. The file names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention.
